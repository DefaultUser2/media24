**MyFlix App**

The app has a bottom navigator with 3 tabs.  Clicking on each tab moves to a differnt screen.

Only the first tab has information on it.  It shows a dynamic list of movie categories, called from the movie api. Clicking on the "GO TO DETAILS" button moves it to a next screen but doesnt show any info.  This is how far I managed to get with the project.
